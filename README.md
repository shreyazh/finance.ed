## Inspiration

Financial literacy is essential, yet many find it intimidating or dull. We wanted to create a platform that combines education with gamification to make learning about finance accessible, engaging, and rewarding. The idea was inspired by the need to motivate users to improve their financial skills while having fun.

## What it does

Finance.ed is a tokenized learning platform that provides free financial education. Users can:
- Take courses and quizzes.
- Earn tokens for successful quiz completions.
- Redeem tokens for real-world rewards such as gift cards, merchandise, or cryptocurrency.

This approach ensures users stay motivated while building essential financial knowledge.

- **Course Integration:** Leveraged APIs and embedded links from platforms like Coursera and Udemy for free educational content.
- **Quiz System:** Developed an interactive quiz feature to test knowledge after each course.
